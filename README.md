# Trema edge

This is a temporary repository that we create in order to receive some
valuable feedback from our users. In the future we are planning to
merge this repository into the current trema repository.

## Trema for OpenFlow 1.3.0

We have already developed source that implements the OpenFlow 1.3.0
specification and we also planning to include the newer OpenFlow
version 1.3.1.
The current implementation is C only.
Trema for OpenFlow 1.3 does not support OpenFlow version 1.0.

Status of implementation:

* `trema command`: will not work
* `libtrema`: works
* `switch_manager, switch daemon`: works
* `tremashark`: not yet implemented
* `src/examples/dumper`: works (C only)
* `src/examples/learning_switch`: works (C only)
* `trema apps`: not work

## Tested platforms

* Ruby 1.8.7 (1.9.x is NOT supported yet)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (amd64)

It may also run on other GNU/Linux distributions but is not tested.

## Required Packages

This repository has only been tested with ruby 1.9.3 and will not work with lower versions.
We recommend installation of the rvm program in order to install ruby 1.9.3.

## Build trema

The familiar build.rb command is not fixed yet therefore to build trema-edge please use the rake command.
    % rake
The `rake` command reads the default `rakefile` found on the current directory.
Ensure that the gem rake-compiler 0.7.0 is installed and in addition the package xutils-dev also installed since it is required by
the makedepend program that the rake-compiler gem is using.
The `Rakefile` file that contains testing suite scripts has not been integrated into the build yet and can not be used

## Run learning switch

    % ./learning_switch.sh start

    Stop learning switch
    % ./learning_switch.sh stop

## How to build your own controller application

### To build

    % mkdir work
    % cd work
    % vi sample.c
    ..
    % cat sample.c
    #include <inttypes.h>
    #include "trema.h"
    
    static void
    handle_switch_ready( uint64_t datapath_id, void *user_data ) {
      info( "Hello %#" PRIx64 " from %s!", datapath_id, user_data );
      stop_trema();
    }
    
    int
    main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
      init_trema( &argc, &argv );
    
      set_switch_ready_handler( handle_switch_ready, argv[ 0 ] );
    
      start_trema();
    
      return 0;
    }
    % cc `../trema-config -c` -o sample sample.c `../trema-config -l`
    % cd ..

### To start the controller

    % ./trema-run.sh ./work/sample start
    
    Stop controller
    % ./trema-run.sh ./work/sample stop

# About OpenFlow 1.3.0

## Notable modifications

+ Multiple tables,groups support (Setting of multiple tables, groups).
+ Extensible match support. (Extensible match support applicable to MPLS and IPv6 match setting).
+ Extensible packet rewrite support. (Extensible packet rewrite support applicable to MPLS and IPv6).
+ Support for added packet-in contents. (Support for additional cookie and match fields).

## Frequently used packets expanded hence processing time increased.

+ The packet-in has been expanded to include the cookie and the match fields.
+ The `flow_mod` that had only match+actions has been expanded to match+instructions+actions.

## Unsupported

+ The cookie mask is to be used in `flow_mod` modify/delete and `flow_stats_request` and
  `aggregate_stats_request`. As currently trema does the cookie translation it is a problem.

## Differences seen by applications

+ `Flow_mod` is necessary after switch connection establishment since the default packet-in is not sent.
+ Since the cookie field is attached to packet-in the application can also attach it to `flow_mod`.
+ It is necessary to search for the `in_port` included in the match of the packet-in.
+ Since the features reply doesn't include port information it is necessary to use a different method to retrieve. (`OFPT_MULTIPART_REQUEST`)
