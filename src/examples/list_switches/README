This directory includes an example that demonstrates how you can
retrieve the list of OpenFlow switches currently connected.

# How to Run (C version)

Run this:

  % ./trema run -c ./src/examples/list_switches/list_switches.conf ./objects/examples/list_switches/list_switches

then you will be able to see the list of switches (datapath ids)
periodically.

  switches = 0xe0, 0xe1, 0xe2, 0xe3

# How to Run (Ruby version)

  % ./trema run -c ./src/examples/list_switches/list_switches.conf ./src/examples/list_switches/list-switches.rb

Enjoy!
