This is a Ruby wrapper around the ifconfig command.  The goal is to make
getting any information that ifconfig provides easy to access.

It was developed on Linux 2.6 with ifconfig from net-tools 1.60.  It also has
support for SunOS, Darwin and Open, Free, Net, and DragonflyBSD.  These have
not been thoroughly tested.  Non Linux platforms call netstat for interface
packet information

Please send me ifconfig / netstat output for platforms that don't work.

see test/*.rb for usage examples.

Thanks to Peter Johnson for the *BSD examples
Thanks to Jeremy Tregunna for Darwin and DragonflyBSD support
