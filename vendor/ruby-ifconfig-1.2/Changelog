Version 1.1
- New features courtesy of Jeremy Tregunna
* Fixed "command not found" error when executing "netstat" on some of the BSD's
* Added support for Darwin and DragonFly BSD
* Added unit tests for Darwin and DragonFly as well as ifconfig examples
* Added three methods (1 public, 2 private) to common/ifconfig.rb:
  - valid_addr? - Checks the supplied type and executes one of two private
  methods to verify that the specified address is valid. Returns false if not.

  - valid_v4? and valid_v6? private methods will return true if the supplied
  address is a valid ipv4 or ipv6 address (respectfully).
